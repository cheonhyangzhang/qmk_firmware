* for technikable keyboard
  holding down J in nvim is not moving the cursor properly
* for corne lp keyboard
    understand in previous attempt, try to use m,.k as the mouse movement instead of jkli with the goal of have a clear
    mindset whether I am currently in base layer or mouse layer.
    This attempt was aborted due to the incomfortable by tapping on lower rows
    However, after more frequent usage of jkli as the mouse keys, the right middle finder is experiencing a lot of
    fatigue when holding one i or ji or il.
    With that, maybe we can try using m,.k again
* when using keyboard for zoom in and zoom out cmd+ and cmd-, needs an easier way to do quick zoom in and out
    e.g. using keyboard with ipad maps
