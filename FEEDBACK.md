    tried to use 3rd row to be the home of mouse keys, this helps to immediately know mouse layer is activated.
    Based on typing data, it turns out to back to base layer key is pressed a lot due to uncertainty base or mouse layer
    is activated.
    However, after using this for several days, turns out the 3rd row approach is not comfortable to hit.
    There are more tensions to the fingers when using 3rd row as the mouse movement.
    Also the pinky to hit to base layer is also not a great idea. Pinky is not accurate and also experiences fatigue.

    Leverage f locaiton as the to base layer, this has a side effect of hitting to base twice will end up with f key pressed. This is because holding on cmd layer key is no longer works
